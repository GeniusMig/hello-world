Practice for github

Hey, I'm Miguel!

My friends call me Mig. I'm an aspiring web developer! 
I enjoy the process of learning how to code. Everytime I learn something new, it feels as if I have gained a new super power. A new idea for an app contantly pops into my head as I learn more. I also enjoy longboarding, biking, and hiking.
